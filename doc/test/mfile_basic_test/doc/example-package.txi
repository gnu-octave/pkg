@top Manual for the example-package for Octave

This documentation applies to version @PACKAGEVERSION of the
example-package.

This is a template simple m-file based package for users.

Normally, a package manual should be structured and should contain more
than just the helptexts of the functions.

* Concept index::                     Concept index.
